<-- 1 or 2 paragraph overview/sales pitch of project>
This is a responsive website dedicated to the Finnish musical group Apocalyptica. 
## UX
Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.
ADD LINK TO WIREFRAMES FOLDER, or link to each specific one (mobile, desktop)


## User Story 
As a fan, I want to know the band's touring schedule, so I can buy tickets to see them in concert. 
As a fan, I want to see pictures of the band, see video of their performance, and read about thier history.
As a fan, I want to read the discography so I can learn about albums I might want to buy.
As a fan, I want to send messages of support or questions to the band so I can connect with them. 
 

## Features
examples: contact form
### Existing Features
Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
...
For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:
### Features left to implement
another future idea

## Technologies used
languages, frameworks, libraries etc used. For each, give the name, link to the official site and a short sentence of why it was used
bootstrap 4, html, css

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Users can see photos of the band on each page, and a gallery of photos on the Photos page. Additionally, the footer has links to Apocolyptica's Instagram and Facebook for more photos. 

Users can see video of the band in concert on the Homepage, and access additional video of the band by visiting the Apocalyptica YouTube channel linked in the footer. 

Users can read about the band in the Bio section on the homepage, and access more information about them by following the Facebook link in the footer. 

Users can see the concert calendar on the homepage, so they can plan to attend a concert. 

Users can send questions or comments to the band using the Contact form on the homepage. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
## Deployment
To run this website locally, it is useful to install the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code. When the Live Server extension is installed, there are two ways to run the website locally. Open Visual Studio Code, and open the folder containing the project. Open the index.html file. There is a toolbar at the bottom of the screen. Click on the button "Go Live". If that button is not showing, you may need to run the extension from the command palette. Search for Live Server and select Run. Your browser will then open and display the Apocalyptica website. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
